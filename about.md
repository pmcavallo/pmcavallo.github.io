I'm a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Political Economy and over five years of experience developing predictive models and risk analytics in highly regulated financial environments. My work bridges the rigor of academic research with the practical demands of business strategy—translating complex questions into scalable, data-driven solutions. My academic background spans institutions in the U.S. and U.K., and I’ve published peer-reviewed research on foreign investment and economic policy. I’m passionate about applying statistical modeling and machine learning to real-world challenges—whether in finance, policy, or business operations.
