I build multi-agent AI systems for regulated industries, where "it works" isn't enough and every decision needs a paper trail.

Current focus: AI orchestration, RAG architectures, and agent memory systems. Recent work includes a multi-agent documentation system achieving 100% source fidelity and a 3-tier memory architecture that learns across sessions.

5+ years in quantitative modeling taught me what production-ready actually means: auditable, explainable, and built to survive scrutiny. I bring that discipline to AI systems.

## 💼 Focus Areas

- **AI Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems**: LangGraph workflows, agent memory, dynamic routing, and audit trails for production deployment.
- **Model Development**: Forecasting, scenario analysis, and credit risk modeling using Python, SAS, and SQL in production-level environments.
- **MLOps & Cloud Deployment**: End-to-end pipelines with Docker, MLflow, FastAPI, AWS, and GCP.
- **RAG & LLM Engineering**: Zero-hallucination architectures, schema validation, retrieval pipelines, and source-grounded generation..
- **Scalable Data Workflows**: Developing modular, reproducible analytics using PySpark, partitioned data lakes, and serverless/cloud-native deployment for monitoring and performance.
- **Telecom & Network Analytics**: Anomaly detection, churn prediction, and 4G/5G KPI monitoring with multi-cloud deployment.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Simulating segmentation, churn, and engagement modeling use cases across diverse industries.


## 📚 Academic & Research Background

Educated in the U.S. and U.K., I’ve published peer-reviewed research on foreign investment and economic policy. My academic rigor informs my approach to real-world data challenges. I believe the greatest value lies not in a perfect model, but in a model you can trust, explain, and maintain. Beyond data, I’m drawn to storytelling, visual communication, and exploring how complex ideas become intuitive.

## 🌍 Languages & Interests

Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; advanced in French and Italian. I enjoy exploring languages, data visualization, and refining communication through storytelling.
