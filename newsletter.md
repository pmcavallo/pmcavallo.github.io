![Exit Code 2](https://github.com/pmcavallo/pmcavallo.github.io/blob/master/images/logo_code2.png?raw=true) 

**Governance that works. Guardrails that execute.**

A newsletter for practitioners building AI systems in regulated industries, where "it works" isn't enough and every decision needs a paper trail.

Each issue covers real governance patterns, regulatory frameworks (SR 11-7, EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF), and hard-won lessons from 5+ years validating models in banking. No theory without practice. No hype without receipts.
