## 📊 Customer Churn Predictor

**Goal**: Predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn using an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

**Description**:  
This interactive app allows users to input customer features (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges) and receive a real-time churn prediction. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, cloud deployment, and live user interaction.
