# AI-in-the-Cloud Knowledge Shootout: Perplexity vs NotebookLM (09/14/2025)

This project set out to answer a simple but important question: can AI tools themselves act as orchestrators of cloud knowledge? After building the [Cross-Cloud Shootout](https://pmcavallo.github.io/cross-cloud/) to compare AWS and GCP directly, I wanted to pit two AI copilots ‚Äî **Perplexity Pro** and **Google NotebookLM** ‚Äî against each other. The goal was to see how each tool handled real cloud prompts across cost optimization, architecture design, and governance, and whether their answers could be relied on for strategic or operational decision-making.

From the beginning, the experiment was uneven by design. NotebookLM requires a curated corpus, so for each prompt I loaded it with AWS and GCP documentation, pricing pages, and my own Cross-Cloud blog. This meant it behaved like a research assistant: highly aligned to those inputs, precise in tone, but limited to what I gave it. Perplexity, by contrast, could not be given a preloaded corpus. It searched the open web in real time, citing blogs, docs, and technical guides it found along the way. It acted more like a field guide: fast, broad, and pragmatic, but not tied to the framing I wanted. The difference between the two approaches became the story of the shootout.

The test design consisted of six prompts, two in each category. For cost optimization, the tools were asked first to design a budget-constrained ML pipeline (COST_01), and later to compare the economics of training versus inference for a mid-size team (COST_02). For architecture fit, they first explored how to deliver telecom-grade low-latency inference (ARCH_01), then tackled the harder problem of a hybrid control plane spanning AWS and GCP (ARCH_02). Finally, for governance, they compared compliance frameworks and enforcement mechanisms (GOV_01), and closed with the design of a model governance baseline for credit risk PD estimation models (GOV_02).

Across these six steps, the contrast between the tools was striking. NotebookLM consistently produced long, detailed answers that read like policy documents or whitepapers. When asked about cost optimization, it leaned heavily on governance levers, structured playbooks, and predictable billing frameworks, often echoing ideas from my Cross-Cloud shootout. Its answers were grounded and complete, rarely skipping a piece of the prompt. Perplexity, on the other hand, delivered tables, checklists, and concrete numbers. It listed hourly rates for SageMaker and Vertex AI instances, mapped services to categories, and described system architectures with edge placement and failover scenarios. Where NotebookLM was deep, Perplexity was clear; where NotebookLM was structured, Perplexity was practical.

The governance prompts highlighted this divergence most clearly. NotebookLM built out a governance baseline that would not be out of place in a regulatory framework: documentation requirements, approval workflows, lineage and reproducibility, all mapped carefully to AWS and GCP services. Perplexity gave a checklist: start with model cards, enable audit logs, use metadata tracking, monitor for bias and drift. Both were correct, but each spoke to a different audience, the compliance officer on one hand, the practitioner on the other.

By the end of the shootout, the pattern was clear. NotebookLM is at its best when you want controlled, source-aligned synthesis. It ‚Äúthinks like a policy author.‚Äù Perplexity is strongest when you need concise, actionable answers quickly. It ‚Äúthinks like a practitioner writing a runbook.‚Äù Neither tool is a winner on its own; the real value comes from combining them. NotebookLM sets the strategy, while Perplexity supplies the tactics.

The lesson of this project is that LLMs are not yet full orchestrators of cloud strategy. But in tandem, they can support both ends of the spectrum: strategic frameworks and day-to-day execution. In that sense, this AI shootout reflects the broader reality of cloud computing itself ‚Äî no single provider, tool, or perspective is enough. The power lies in integration, in building systems where strengths complement each other.

# LLM Quiz App: Lessons from Building Across ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude (09/14/2025)

This project started with a simple idea: I wanted a quiz tracker app. ChatGPT was struggling to incorporate a quiz with a memory component in its daily tasks, so the workaround was to build a small local ‚Äúagent.‚Äù The plan was straightforward: ask questions, grade answers, and persist results in a local database using RAG to recall past attempts. It sounded ambitious, but at its core, it was supposed to be just that, an app that tracks quizzes.  

ChatGPT initially pitched a small web app with an API that I could run locally with a browser UI. Over time, it kept suggesting new features it could not actually implement. After a few days of false starts, we finally had something: an MVP. It worked well enough, with logging, summaries, a session-aware Bottom-3, randomized and non-repeating question selection, and a large question bank. It was not the adaptive LLM-powered engine that was first envisioned, but it did the job.  

Frustrated but still curious, I tried Gemini next. It promised a real-time coding experience in Canvas, with prompts on one side and a live editor on the other. The interface looked sleek, with buttons, a tracker title, and a ‚Äúfix error‚Äù button that popped up after every crash. Gemini would identify bugs, explain them, and claim to fix them, only for the same black screen and ‚Äúfix error‚Äù button to reappear. After two days, I still did not have an app that could run outside of Gemini.  

Gemini also assumed I wanted a multi-user app, so it pushed Firebase for memory and Netlify for hosting. That was not my goal, I only needed local persistence so the tracker would not reset each session. The Firebase and Netlify approach quickly became fragile without a proper build process, running into race conditions and security issues that a production pipeline would normally solve.  

At this point, I pivoted to Claude. Right away, it suggested starting with a self-contained app, a simple HTML file with persistence across browser sessions. That worked immediately on Netlify, no Firebase required. I was impressed with Claude‚Äôs stability and its ability to preserve file integrity while implementing fixes. Unlike ChatGPT or Gemini, it did not regress or produce broken versions with each change. But then I hit its hard usage limits. Even on Pro, I was locked out for five hours after hitting the quota. That made iterative work, the style I rely on, impossible. With Claude, you must be strategic, efficient, and very clear in prompts. There is no space for the back-and-forth experimentation I enjoy with ChatGPT.  

Armed with the lessons from Claude, I went back to Gemini and asked for a self-contained app with only session persistence, no API or cloud services. This time it delivered a clean, minimal app with a fun icon-based interface. I gave the same instructions to ChatGPT and it did produce a self-contained app with even more complex graphs than Gemini, albeit a less clean and visually appealing interface. I just had to do the same thing with Claude now. But I was still waiting for my Claude lockout to end.

### Best Practices I Learned for Claude

**Maximize each message**  
- Provide full context and requirements upfront  
- Be comprehensive rather than incremental  
- Bundle related requests together  

**Use strategic prompting**  
- Specify format, length, and expectations  
- Give examples of what you want  
- Use structured prompts with sections  

**Plan sessions carefully**  
- Group related work  
- Prioritize complex tasks first  
- Offload simple tasks to other tools  

---

One of Claude‚Äôs limitations is file size. It struggles with large outputs and large inputs, and once its 200k-token context window fills, you need to start a new chat. Unlike ChatGPT, it cannot access artifacts from previous sessions. Every new chat means re-uploading context and files.  

Even with these issues, I liked Claude. It is fast, practical, and makes smart suggestions unprompted. But it cannot stand alone, you would need at least one other LLM alongside it. ChatGPT remains the most versatile for general use, while Gemini offers extra value through Google‚Äôs ecosystem and services.  

For this app project, each LLM had strengths and weaknesses. All of them produced usable quiz apps, though none fully achieved the original vision: a self-contained app that also tapped its LLM creator for infinite questions, explanations, and personalized study plans. That dream turned out to be too ambitious.  

Still, I ended up with something real: a working quiz tracker, lessons in cross-LLM development, and a deeper appreciation of how these tools differ not just in features but in workflow philosophy.

# Cross-Cloud AutoML Shootout: Lessons from the Trenches. (09/10/2025)

With the **Cross-Cloud AutoML Shootout** project the idea was straightforward: pit AWS SageMaker Autopilot against Google Cloud‚Äôs AutoML, feed them the same dataset, and see who comes out on top in terms of accuracy, speed, and cost. What happened instead turned into a lesson about quotas, governance, and adaptability in cloud AI.

Just like in my credit risk modeling work, where the challenge often isn‚Äôt the math itself but the infrastructure and constraints, this shootout was as much about system design as it was about algorithms. AWS and GCP offered very different paths, and those differences reshaped the entire project.

But the project wasn‚Äôt just about comparing two black-box services. It was about uncovering how each cloud handles scale, transparency, and control:

- **AWS Autopilot: Fast Start, Pay-as-You-Go**  
  Autopilot trained 10 candidate models in 30 minutes, surfacing a solid performer with ~65% accuracy and ~0.78 ROC AUC. Cost: about $10. The tradeoff: limited visibility into feature importance‚Äîgood performance, but little interpretability.

- **GCP Vertex AI AutoML: Quota Walls Everywhere**  
  On paper, Vertex AI AutoML should have been the competitor. In practice, hidden quotas derailed every attempt. Even after raising CPU quotas twice, the pipeline kept failing with opaque errors. Without a paid support plan, there was no path forward.

- **Pivot to BigQuery ML: Control Through SQL**  
  Instead of abandoning the project, I pivoted. With BigQuery ML, I wrote SQL directly to train models, engineer features, and evaluate results. The boosted tree model came in slightly weaker (~56% accuracy, ~0.74 ROC AUC), but I gained full transparency, feature importance, and‚Äîcritically‚Äîpredictable cost. Under 1 TiB/month, it was effectively free.

## Lessons Learned

- **Cloud Governance Matters**: GCP AutoML‚Äôs hidden quotas were a reminder that cloud experiments aren‚Äôt just technical, they‚Äôre operational.  
- **Transparency vs. Accuracy**: AWS won on performance, but BigQuery ML gave us the interpretability that regulated industries demand.  
- **Cost Awareness**: The shootout underscored how pricing models (per-second vs. node-hour vs. query bytes) drive design decisions.  
- **Adaptability as a Skill**: The pivot itself was a success. Knowing when to change course is part of building resilient AI systems.

The name ‚ÄúShootout‚Äù now reflects more than just a head-to-head test. It captures the reality of working across clouds: the contest isn‚Äôt just between models, but between philosophies of control, cost, and transparency.  

Why does this matter? Because in AI, as in finance, **constraints shape outcomes**.

# SignalGraph: Telecom Data Pipelines Reimagined (08/30/2025)

When I launched **SignalGraph**, the idea was simple: treat telecom network data with the same care and structure that financial institutions give to credit risk data. In practice, that meant building a pipeline that could transform raw, messy network logs into a structured system where anomalies, trends, and performance could be analyzed at scale.

Just like in my banking work, where I‚Äôve spent years reconciling multiple servicer feeds and correcting default timing errors, SignalGraph began with the fundamentals: data integrity. The project ingests raw Bronze-layer parquet files, standardizes them in Silver with anomaly flags, and prepares feature-rich Gold outputs. Each step ensures consistency, comparability, and readiness for modeling.

But the project wasn‚Äôt just about ETL. It was about bringing together a full ecosystem:

- **Anomaly Detection:** In finance, a default can be seen as an anomaly‚Äîa rare, high-impact event that needs to be captured correctly. In telecom, latency spikes and overloaded cells serve a similar role. SignalGraph flags anomalies (latency > 60ms, PRB > 85%) directly in the Silver layer so they are never lost in downstream aggregation.
- **Feature Engineering at Scale:** Gold-layer datasets include hourly features, giving analysts and models the inputs they need for prediction and trend analysis.
- **Modeling and Forecasting:** SignalGraph is designed to support both baseline predictive models (XGBoost, Random Forests) and forecasting tools like Prophet for time-series latency predictions.
- **Graph Analytics:** Using Neo4j, the project explores neighbor effects and centrality‚Äîcritical for understanding how one weak node can ripple through a telecom network.
- **Governance and Transparency:** Just like my regulatory work at Comerica, every stage of SignalGraph is documented and auditable. The design emphasizes trust, reproducibility, and clarity.

The name *SignalGraph* reflects this dual ambition: it‚Äôs not only about signals in the network, but also about connecting the nodes, people, tools, models, and governance into a coherent graph.

Why does this matter? Because in telecom, as in finance, anomalies aren‚Äôt just noise. They‚Äôre signals‚Äîwarnings of where risk is building or where performance is degrading. SignalGraph shows how an end-to-end AI/ML system can surface those signals, structure them for decision-making, and keep them flowing into live dashboards and predictive models.

# One Project. Three Platforms. (08/16/2025)

NetworkIQ started as a simple idea. I wanted one pipeline that I could move between platforms without rewriting the heart of the work. The goal was to ingest telecom-style telemetry, shape it into clean features, train a baseline model to detect latency anomalies, and give stakeholders a friendly view to explore results. Same project, three homes. Render for speed. AWS for scale and control. GCP for a pragmatic middle ground.

Working across platforms forced me to separate what is essential from what is incidental. The essential parts are the business logic and the modeling flow. The incidental parts are authentication, packaging, endpoints, and scheduling. When I kept that separation clear, the project moved with me.

## Render: first link to share

Render was the shortest path to something I could show. I connected a repository, set a few environment variables, and had a public URL I could send to a colleague the same day. That matters when momentum is everything. Streamlit felt natural here, and the platform handled build and deploy so I could focus on the story the data was telling.

The tradeoff is that Render is not where I want to crunch heavy Spark jobs or run long training runs. It shines when I need a clean demo, a quick what-if tool, or a lightweight API. For NetworkIQ, that meant pushing precomputed features and model artifacts to the app and keeping the heavy lifting elsewhere. For stakeholder conversations this was perfect. People could see the problem, adjust thresholds, and understand operational implications without waiting on infrastructure.

## AWS: scale and controls

When I needed stronger controls and a clearer path to enterprise practices, AWS was the natural step. S3 gave me a stable lake for Parquet data and versioned artifacts. Glue or EMR ran PySpark transforms when feature builds became heavier. SageMaker provided a place to train and track models with the permissioning and logging that risk and security teams expect.

The price of that power is setup time and cognitive load. Policies, roles, networking, and service limits have to be right, and each decision has ripple effects. Once it is in place it feels robust. For NetworkIQ, AWS made sense when I asked how to hand this to another team, how to secure it properly, and how to monitor it over time. This is the platform I would pick for a regulated environment or a high-traffic deployment that cannot fail quietly.

## GCP: pragmatic analytics

On GCP I found a productive middle. Cloud Storage handled the data lake side without fuss. Dataproc and notebooks were straightforward for Spark work. Vertex AI was an opinionated yet flexible path to train and serve. Cloud Run made it simple to put a small service on the internet without managing servers.

For NetworkIQ, the appeal was speed with enough structure to feel professional. I would choose it for teams that want managed services with a simpler day-one experience, especially when BigQuery is part of the analytics stack. It was also an easy place to stitch together a scheduled job and a lightweight service without touching too many knobs.

## What stayed constant

Across all three platforms the core of NetworkIQ did not change. The data model, the way I engineered features, and the way the model consumed them stayed the same. I kept artifacts and data in open formats and wrote the pipeline so that storage, secrets, and endpoints were swappable. That discipline paid off. Moving the project was about replacing adapters and configuration, not rewriting logic.

## What changed

What changed was everything around the edges. Authentication flows were different. Deployment packaging had to follow each platform‚Äôs rules. Schedulers had different names and limits. Monitoring and logs lived in different places. None of this changed the value of the project, but it did change how quickly I could iterate and how easily I could meet enterprise expectations.

## When I would choose each

I choose Render when I want a live demo today, when the purpose is conversation, or when a simple app needs to be shareable without ceremony.  
I choose AWS when I need strong governance, integration with enterprise tooling, and room for production growth.  
I choose GCP when I want managed services that get me moving fast, especially for analytics teams that live in notebooks and SQL and want a clean path to serving.

## What I learned about orchestration

The most important lesson from NetworkIQ is that portability is a mindset. If I treat the cloud as the place I run the project rather than the project itself, I retain the freedom to move. That freedom is strategic. It lets me optimize for speed when I am validating an idea and for robustness when I am scaling it. It also keeps the conversation with stakeholders focused on outcomes, not tools.
