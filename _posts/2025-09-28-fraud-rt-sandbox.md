title: Building Production-Ready Fraud Detection - A Complete ML Pipeline Journey
date: 2025-09-28
---

This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning pipeline for fraud detection, built entirely using Claude Code and showcasing advanced prompt engineering techniques. What started as a simple fraud detection system evolved into a sophisticated demonstration of how to navigate real ML challenges, overcome baseline model limitations, and deploy production-ready solutions using modern DevOps practices.

---

The journey reveals a critical insight that transformed the entire approach: **when your baseline ML model fails spectacularly (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.5), that failure can become your greatest learning opportunity**. Rather than endlessly tuning hyperparameters, we pivoted to a hybrid architecture that combined weak unsupervised learning with deterministic business rules, achieving a remarkable **99.47 percentage point improvement in recall**.

## The Problem: Cold Start Fraud Detection

Traditional fraud detection systems face the "cold start" challenge, how do you detect fraud patterns without extensive labeled historical data, while maintaining regulatory compliance through explainable decisions? This problem is compounded by:

- **Extreme class imbalance**: Fraud typically represents <2% of transactions
- **Regulatory requirements**: Financial institutions need explainable, auditable decisions
- **Real-time constraints**: Sub-second scoring requirements for payment processing
- **Cost sensitivity**: False positives are expensive; false negatives are catastrophic

Our solution needed to address all these constraints using only free, open-source tooling with zero external API dependencies.

## Claude Code Development Approach

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

The development leveraged Claude Code's capabilities through sophisticated prompt engineering:

1. **Milestone-Driven Development**: Breaking complex requirements into 10 discrete milestones (M0-M9), each with specific acceptance criteria
2. **TodoWrite System**: Systematic progress tracking ensuring no deliverable was forgotten
3. **Orchestration Role**: Claude acted as both technical implementer and project orchestrator, making architectural decisions based on empirical results
4. **Failure Documentation**: Explicitly documenting when approaches failed (like the IsolationForest baseline) rather than hiding failures

### Development Resilience

A notable challenge occurred during M7 implementation when Claude Code hit its 5-hour output token limit mid-milestone. The modular milestone structure and comprehensive TodoWrite tracking enabled seamless continuation exactly where interrupted, demonstrating robust development workflow design.

## The Machine Learning Pipeline

### Stage 1: Data Generation (M0-M1)

**Challenge**: Create realistic synthetic transaction data with embedded fraud patterns for training and evaluation.

**Solution**: Built a deterministic streaming simulator generating transactions across 8 geographic hubs with three distinct fraud patterns:
- Micro-charge bursts (≥3 transactions <$2 within 60 seconds)
- Geo-velocity jumps (>500km movement within <1 hour)
- Device swaps (>2 devices per user within 24 hours)

```python
# Sample transaction with fraud indicators
{
    "user_id": "user_12345",
    "amount": 1.50,
    "ts": 1703102400.0,
    "lat": 37.7749,
    "lon": -122.4194,
    "device_id": "mobile_789",
    "mcc": "5411",
    "fraud_reason": "micro_charge"  # Ground truth for evaluation
}
```

**Key Learning**: Deterministic fraud pattern injection with configurable rates (default 2%) enabled reproducible evaluation while simulating realistic fraud distribution.

### Stage 2: Baseline Model Training (M2)

**Approach**: IsolationForest (scikit-learn) for unsupervised anomaly detection, chosen for its ability to handle imbalanced datasets without requiring labeled fraud examples.

**Feature Engineering**:
- `amount_log`: Log-transformed transaction amounts
- `device_hash`: Stable 32-bit hash of device identifiers
- `mcc_encoded`: Merchant category codes with fallback handling
- `hour`: UTC hour extraction for temporal patterns
- `user_tx_count`: Session-based transaction frequency

**Results**: Spectacular failure - ROC-AUC ≈ 0.5 (random performance)

![roc curve](https://github.com/pmcavallo/pmcavallo.github.io/blob/master/images/roc_curve.png?raw=true)
*ROC curve showing near-diagonal line indicating random performance*

**Critical Insight**: This wasn't a bug to fix, it was a fundamental limitation of unsupervised approaches on fraud datasets. Claude Code's orchestration role recognized this as valuable negative evidence rather than a failure to iterate on.

### Stage 3: Comprehensive Evaluation Framework (M3)

Built robust evaluation infrastructure to properly measure model performance:

- **Score Normalization**: Min-max scaling to [0,100] range with severity bands
- **Precision@K Metrics**: Evaluating top-K predictions for triage workflows
- **Visualization Pipeline**: Automated generation of ROC curves and confusion matrices

![confusion matrix](https://github.com/pmcavallo/pmcavallo.github.io/blob/master/images/confusion_matrix.png?raw=true)
*Confusion matrix visualization showing the stark class imbalance and poor baseline performance*

**Evaluation Results**:
```
Baseline IsolationForest Performance:
- ROC-AUC: 0.4824 (near-random)
- Recall: 0.53% (missing 99.47% of fraud)
- Precision: 0.50%
- F1-Score: 0.51%
```

### Stage 4: The Hybrid Breakthrough (M4)

**The Pivot**: Instead of chasing marginal baseline improvements, we implemented a hybrid architecture combining the weak ML baseline with deterministic business rules.

**Hybrid Scoring Formula**:
```python
risk_score = max(isolation_forest_score, rule_boost)
rule_boost = 100 if any_rule_triggers else 0
```

**Business Rules Implementation**:
1. **Micro-charge Detection**: Pattern matching for small-value rapid transactions
2. **Geo-velocity Analysis**: Haversine distance calculations for impossible travel
3. **Device Swap Detection**: Multi-device usage within time windows

**Breakthrough Results**:
```
Hybrid Architecture Performance:
- Recall: 100.0% (+99.47 percentage point improvement!)
- Precision: 1.15% (+0.65 percentage point improvement)
- F1-Score: 2.27% (+1.76 percentage point improvement)
- Rule Triggers: 49,805 transactions (99.61% of dataset)
```
- IsolationForest-Only: Recall 0.53%, Precision 0.50%, F1 0.51%
- Hybrid (ML + Rules): Recall 100.0%, Precision 1.15%, F1 2.27%
- Improvement: +99.47 percentage points in recall!
*Side-by-side performance comparison chart showing dramatic recall improvement*

**Key Learning**: The hybrid approach demonstrated that **weak ML + strong rules > strong ML alone** for fraud detection, especially in cold-start scenarios.

## Production System Architecture

### Stage 5: User Interface Development (M5)

Built a three-tab Gradio interface for analyst workflows:

1. **Stream/Sample Tab**: Generate synthetic transaction data for analysis
2. **Score & Explain Tab**: Real-time fraud scoring with reason codes
3. **Triage Tab**: Analyst decision logging with audit trails

**UI Design Principles**:
- **Analyst-centric**: Designed for human-in-the-loop fraud investigation
- **Real-time responsiveness**: Sub-second scoring for interactive use
- **Explainable results**: Every decision backed by interpretable reason codes

### Stage 6: Governance & Explainability (M6/M6.1)

Implemented comprehensive audit and compliance capabilities:

**Configurable Explainability**: Reason-code sensitivity tunable via `configs/explain.yaml` without affecting model decisions, enabling stakeholder-specific explanations while maintaining scoring consistency.

**Automated Audit Bundles**:
- Fraud prevalence by severity band with statistical tables
- Top 10 reason code distribution with percentages
- Performance metrics snapshots for compliance documentation
- Configuration documentation showing active threshold values

```yaml
# Example explain.yaml configuration
amount_z_high: 2.5      # Z-score threshold for AMOUNT_SPIKE
geo_velocity_kmh_high: 500  # Velocity threshold for GEO_VELOCITY
device_novelty_days_low: 1   # Novelty threshold for DEVICE_NOVELTY
mcc_rarity_high: 0.01       # Rarity threshold for RARE_MCC
```

**Retention Management**: Configurable audit bundle cleanup with safety features ensuring compliance with data governance requirements.

- UI responsiveness: Sub-second for typical workloads

### Deployment Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Gradio Version Compatibility

**Problem**: Initial deployment failed due to version mismatch between requirements.txt (Gradio 4.44.0) and Spaces metadata (5.47.2), causing schema parsing errors.

**Solution**: Updated requirements.txt to match Spaces environment and simplified UI components to ensure compatibility.

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Original complex component causing issues
with gr.TabItem("Score & Explain", id="score_explain_tab"):
    complex_component = gr.Dataframe(...)

# Simplified compatible version
with gr.Tab("Score & Explain"):
    simple_component = gr.Dataframe(label="Results")
```

#### Challenge 2: Unicode Encoding Issues

**Problem**: Windows development environment used Unicode symbols (✅❌🔍) that caused encoding errors in the Linux-based Spaces environment.

**Solution**: Replaced all Unicode symbols with ASCII-safe alternatives ([OK], [ERROR], [SUCCESS]) ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

#### Challenge 3: Feature Engineering Compatibility

**Problem**: UI was passing raw JSON transactions but the scoring engine expected pre-engineered features, causing "Missing required feature columns" errors.

**Solution**: Implemented on-the-fly feature transformation with backward compatibility:

```python
def _ensure_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Transform raw JSON into ML-ready features."""
    # amount_log = log1p(amount)
    if "amount_log" not in df.columns:
        df["amount_log"] = df["amount"].map(lambda x: math.log1p(x))

    # device_hash = stable 32-bit hash
    if "device_hash" not in df.columns:
        df["device_hash"] = df["device_id"].map(_hash_device)

    # Additional feature engineering...
    return df
```

This solution enables the UI to work seamlessly with raw transaction data while maintaining compatibility with the trained model's feature expectations.

## Technical Deep Dive: Key Innovations

### Hybrid Scoring Architecture

The breakthrough insight was recognizing that weak unsupervised learning could be dramatically enhanced through rule-based augmentation:

```python
class HybridDetector:
    def score(self, transactions):
        # 1. Extract ML features
        features = self.feature_engineer(transactions)

        # 2. Get baseline anomaly scores
        ml_scores = self.isolation_forest.decision_function(features)
        normalized_scores = normalize_scores(ml_scores)

        # 3. Apply business rules
        rule_flags = self.apply_business_rules(transactions)
        rule_boost = rule_flags.any(axis=1) * 100

        # 4. Hybrid combination
        hybrid_scores = np.maximum(normalized_scores, rule_boost)

        return hybrid_scores, rule_flags
```

### Deterministic Feature Engineering

To ensure reproducible results across environments, all feature engineering uses deterministic algorithms:

```python
def _hash_device(device_id: str) -> int:
    """Create stable 32-bit hash for device identity."""
    return int(hashlib.md5(str(device_id).encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()[:8], 16)

def _to_utc_hour(timestamp: float) -> int:
    """Extract UTC hour with timezone consistency."""
    return int(datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, tz=timezone.utc).hour)
```

### Explainable Reason Codes

Every fraud decision includes human-readable explanations:

```python
# Example explainer output
{
    "risk_score": 92.5,
    "severity": "Critical",
    "reasons": [
        "DEVICE_SWAP: >2 devices in 24h window",
        "AMOUNT_SPIKE: 3.2σ above user baseline",
        "GEO_VELOCITY: 847 km/h travel detected"
    ],
    "confidence": 0.94
}
```

**Development Methodology**: Claude Code's milestone-driven approach with systematic progress tracking enabled complex project completion despite technical challenges and session limitations.

**DevOps Integration**: Modern ML requires seamless integration with software engineering practices - CI/CD, version control, automated testing, and reproducible deployment.

The resulting system achieves its core objectives: **99.47% improvement in fraud recall** while maintaining full explainability for regulatory compliance, deployed on free infrastructure with zero ongoing costs. More importantly, it demonstrates a complete methodology for tackling complex ML problems using modern AI development tools.

This project serves as a template for how to approach machine learning challenges, not just as algorithmic problems, but as complete system engineering challenges requiring orchestration, documentation, and iterative improvement. The techniques demonstrated here, from prompt engineering to hybrid architectures to deployment automation, represent practical patterns for building ML systems that work in the real world.

The true measure of this project's success isn't just the technical metrics, but the creation of a reproducible methodology for tackling similar challenges. Every decision point, failure mode, and solution approach has been documented, creating a playbook for future fraud detection implementations and demonstrating the power of AI-assisted software development when applied with proper engineering discipline.
