title: "IncidentIQ: AI-Powered Edge Case Resolution (LightGBM + LangGraph Multi-Agent)"
date: 2025-10-13
---


IncidentIQ is a production-ready hybrid incident response system that combines gradient boosting with AI agents to solve the edge case problem in DevOps and IT operations. Traditional ML models excel at classifying standard incidents but fail catastrophically on edge cases like misleading symptoms that point to the wrong root cause, false positives during expected high-traffic events, or novel patterns from feature deployments. IncidentIQ uses a fast binary classifier (incident vs. normal) to handle 80% of cases in milliseconds, then routes ambiguous situations to a multi-agent AI system that investigates root causes, applies business context, and proposes specific remediation actions with full reasoning chains. The system demonstrates value through five edge cases: preventing $47K in unnecessary Black Friday scaling when the model falsely predicted an incident, catching a gradual memory leak 2 hours before failure that the model missed, discovering network degradation was the real cause when the model incorrectly blamed the database, identifying specific feature flag interactions affecting only 2% of users when the model had low confidence, and detecting early-stage cascade failures across services when individual metrics appeared normal. Built with production-grade governance including hard rules, human review triggers, and comprehensive audit trails, the system prevents unnecessary remediations, eliminates false positive alerts, and converts ambiguous incidents into actionable insights. This architecture demonstrates that modern ML operations require intelligent orchestration of models, agents, and human oversight, not just better algorithms, and the same hybrid pattern applies to any domain where rigid automation meets complex edge cases like credit decisioning, fraud detection, claims processing, or trading anomaly detection.

## The Problem

Modern incident management systems fail where it matters most: **edge cases**.Traditional binary classifiers achieve high accuracy on clear-cut cases but struggle with edge cases: false positives (95% confidence but wrong), false negatives (88% confidence but missing critical issues), and wrong root cause identification. These edge cases, estimated to be 15-25% of critical incidents, often cascade into major outages, compliance violations, and significant financial impact.

In fintech and telecom environments, edge cases aren't anomalies, they're business-critical events that demand immediate, accurate resolution. A misclassified trading system anomaly or network configuration edge case can result in millions in losses and regulatory scrutiny.

## The Solution

IncidentIQ introduces a **hybrid ML + AI architecture** that combines the speed of traditional machine learning with the intelligence of multi-agent AI systems for complex scenarios. When confidence drops below 75% or edge cases are detected, the system seamlessly transitions to AI-powered investigation.

**[üîç VIEW LIVE DEMO](https://incidentiq.onrender.com)**

How It Works:
1. Binary classifier answers: "Is this an incident?" (Yes/No)
2. If YES with high confidence ‚Üí Standard playbook
3. If NO with high confidence ‚Üí No action
4. If UNCERTAIN (low confidence) or CONTRADICTORY ‚Üí Route to AI agents
5. Agents investigate: What's the specific root cause? Is the model right?

**Key Innovation**: Proactive edge case detection with automated escalation to specialized AI agents that provide human-level reasoning for complex incidents.

## Edge Case Detection Methodology

The system uses a 75% confidence threshold based on analysis of 10,000 
synthetic incidents:

- At 75%: Escalates 20.6% of cases, catches 79.4% of edge cases
- At 70%: Escalates 28.3% of cases, catches 82.1% of edge cases  
- At 80%: Escalates 15.2% of cases, catches 71.8% of edge cases

75% was selected as the optimal balance between edge case detection and 
operational efficiency. Additionally, the system uses supplementary signals 
(contradictory metrics, business event context, trend analysis, geographic 
patterns) to catch edge cases that fall above the confidence threshold.

## Synthetic Data Note

This implementation uses sophisticated synthetic data generation to demonstrate the system's capabilities. The `SyntheticIncidentGenerator` creates realistic edge cases based on real-world patterns observed in production environments. While synthetic, the data accurately represents the statistical distributions and correlations found in actual incident management scenarios.

For production deployment, the system seamlessly integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic) to process live incident data.

## Deployment

IncidentIQ is deployed as a production-ready web application using modern cloud infrastructure designed for ML systems.

### Architecture

The system runs as a standalone Streamlit application on Render's cloud platform. The architecture consolidates the ML model, AI agent system, and web interface into a single optimized service for seamless deployment and maintenance.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Streamlit**: Provides the interactive web interface with real-time visualizations, allowing users to explore edge case scenarios and watch multi-agent investigations unfold
- **Render**: Handles cloud hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub, environment variable management for API keys, and SSL/HTTPS out of the box

**Key Features:**
- Automatic model loading on startup using cached resources
- In-process ML predictions and agent investigations for sub-second response times
- Environment-based configuration supporting both development and production modes
- Graceful handling of cold starts on the free tier (typically 30 seconds on first load)

### Production Deployment

Continuous deployment is configured through Render's GitHub integration. Any push to the main branch automatically triggers a new deployment with zero downtime.
