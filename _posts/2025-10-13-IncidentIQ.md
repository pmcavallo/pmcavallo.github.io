title: "IncidentIQ: AI-Powered Edge Case Resolution (LightGBM + LangGraph Multi-Agent)"
date: 2025-10-13
---


IncidentIQ is a production-ready hybrid incident response system that combines gradient boosting with AI agents to solve the edge case problem in DevOps and IT operations. Traditional ML models excel at classifying standard incidents but fail catastrophically on edge cases like misleading symptoms that point to the wrong root cause, false positives during expected high-traffic events, or novel patterns from feature deployments. IncidentIQ uses a fast binary classifier (incident vs. normal) to handle 80% of cases in milliseconds, then routes ambiguous situations to a multi-agent AI system that investigates root causes, applies business context, and proposes specific remediation actions with full reasoning chains. The system demonstrates value through five edge cases: preventing $47K in unnecessary Black Friday scaling when the model falsely predicted an incident, catching a gradual memory leak 2 hours before failure that the model missed, discovering network degradation was the real cause when the model incorrectly blamed the database, identifying specific feature flag interactions affecting only 2% of users when the model had low confidence, and detecting early-stage cascade failures across services when individual metrics appeared normal. Built with production-grade governance including hard rules, human review triggers, and comprehensive audit trails, the system prevents unnecessary remediations, eliminates false positive alerts, and converts ambiguous incidents into actionable insights. This architecture demonstrates that modern ML operations require intelligent orchestration of models, agents, and human oversight, not just better algorithms, and the same hybrid pattern applies to any domain where rigid automation meets complex edge cases like credit decisioning, fraud detection, claims processing, or trading anomaly detection.

## The Problem

Modern incident management systems fail where it matters most: **edge cases**. While traditional ML models achieve 60-70% accuracy on standard scenarios, they collapse to 20-30% on outliers, exactly when organizations need them most. These edge cases, representing 15-25% of critical incidents, often cascade into major outages, compliance violations, and significant financial impact.

In fintech and telecom environments, edge cases aren't anomalies, they're business-critical events that demand immediate, accurate resolution. A misclassified trading system anomaly or network configuration edge case can result in millions in losses and regulatory scrutiny.

## The Solution

IncidentIQ introduces a **hybrid ML + AI architecture** that combines the speed of traditional machine learning with the intelligence of multi-agent AI systems for complex scenarios. When confidence drops below 75% or edge cases are detected, the system seamlessly transitions to AI-powered investigation.

## Demo Scenarios

IncidentIQ demonstrates agent value through 5 edge cases that catch confident ML mistakes:

### Scenario 1: False Positive - Black Friday Traffic
**Input**: 12x normal traffic, CPU 78%, response time 520ms
**ML Model**: 'incident' (95% confidence) → scale infrastructure ($47K cost)
**AI Agents**: 'normal' → Black Friday traffic pattern, metrics within historical range
**Agent Value**: Prevented $47K unnecessary cloud scaling costs

### Scenario 2: False Negative - Gradual Memory Leak
**Input**: Memory at 67% (normal), but increasing 3.5% per hour
**ML Model**: 'normal' (88% confidence) → no action needed
**AI Agents**: 'incident' → Memory leak detected via trend analysis, will hit 95% in 2 hours
**Agent Value**: Caught issue 2 hours before outage, prevented production failure

### Scenario 3: Wrong Root Cause - DB Symptoms, Network Issue
**Input**: High connection pool (89%), elevated response time (850ms), normal DB internals
**ML Model**: 'incident' (91% confidence) → restart database (45min downtime)
**AI Agents**: 'incident' → Network packet loss (2.3%) is real problem, DB healthy
**Agent Value**: Prevented 45min unnecessary DB restart, fixed in 15min by replacing switch

### Scenario 4: Novel Pattern - Feature Flag Interaction
**Input**: Memory leak affecting only 2% of users with specific flag combination
**ML Model**: 'incident' (68% confidence, low) → broad rollback affecting all users
**AI Agents**: 'incident' → Memory leak ONLY when ml_recommendations_v4 + personalized_search_beta
**Agent Value**: Surgical fix affecting 2% vs broad rollback affecting 100% of users

### Scenario 5: Cascade Early Detection - Cross-Service Pattern
**Input**: All individual metrics normal, subtle cross-service correlation
**ML Model**: 'normal' (82% confidence) → no action, metrics within bounds
**AI Agents**: 'incident' → Auth +40ms → API connections +15% → DB queue forming (classic cascade)
**Agent Value**: Prevented full cascade failure, caught 45min before critical threshold

## Synthetic Data Note

This implementation uses sophisticated synthetic data generation to demonstrate the system's capabilities. The `SyntheticIncidentGenerator` creates realistic edge cases based on real-world patterns observed in production environments. While synthetic, the data accurately represents the statistical distributions and correlations found in actual incident management scenarios.

For production deployment, the system seamlessly integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic) to process live incident data.

## Deployment

IncidentIQ is deployed as a production-ready web application using modern cloud infrastructure designed for ML systems.

### Architecture

The system runs as a standalone Streamlit application on Render's cloud platform. The architecture consolidates the ML model, AI agent system, and web interface into a single optimized service for seamless deployment and maintenance.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Streamlit**: Provides the interactive web interface with real-time visualizations, allowing users to explore edge case scenarios and watch multi-agent investigations unfold
- **Render**: Handles cloud hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub, environment variable management for API keys, and SSL/HTTPS out of the box

**Key Features:**
- Automatic model loading on startup using cached resources
- In-process ML predictions and agent investigations for sub-second response times
- Environment-based configuration supporting both development and production modes
- Graceful handling of cold starts on the free tier (typically 30 seconds on first load)

### Production Deployment

Continuous deployment is configured through Render's GitHub integration. Any push to the main branch automatically triggers a new deployment with zero downtime.
