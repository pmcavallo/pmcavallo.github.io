This example uses geocoded (ArcMap) foreign direct investment (FDI) data to analyze and control for spatial autocorrelation in R:

The data for this project comes from the *Finantial Times, BEA, and EMSI*, and the unit of analysis is US states. The dependent variable is greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) (millions of U$ Dollars). This greenfield data eliminates not only the liquid capital component but also Mergers & Acqusitions (M&A), leaving only the job-creating component state officials are eager to attract. 

The main idea of this project, first, is to investigate if FDI clusters geographically, meaning, do some statesâ€™ outcomes depend on the outcomes in other states? In other words, is FDI contagious from states to neighboring or otherwise proximate states? For instance, are Connecticut and New Hampshire receiving more investment than Texas and Colorado due to their proximity to major FDI destinations such as the states of New York and Massachusetts?

The first step is to obtain a shapefile of the US states. Then have the FDI excel file in wide format, meaning each year for the FDI inflow becomes a column (variable). Open the US state shapefile and the FDI CSV file in ArcMap and joing them by a common variable (i.e. state Fips code, geocode, USPS). Finally, you export it back as a shapefile to open in R.

Then, you open the shpefile in R and obtain the states' coordinates (centroids) as follows:

### US-STATES SHAPEFILE ###
statemap<-readShapePoly("D:/DataScience/Summer2020/Project/Export_Output_2.shp",IDvar="GEOID",proj4string=CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"))

map.centroid<-coordinates(statemap)   

```

The next step is to check if there is spatial autocorrelation in the FDI data. To that end, I first build a spatial weights matrix, the heart of any spatial analyses, where the elements are defined to reflect the suspected nature of the hypothesized spatial relationship between the units. The matrix is composed of elements connecting one metro area to every other metro area in the sample, and reflect the strength of the dependence between them. There are two ways to calculate the spatial weights matrix: contiguity (queen and rook), and inverse distance. In the inverse distance case, distance is measured as the geographic distance between the states' centroids defined by the great-circle distance in miles between one state to the other.

The contiguity weight matrix (rook and queen ), is calculated as follows:

```R
map.link <- poly2nb(statemap,queen=T)
map.linkr <- poly2nb(statemap,queen=F)

```

The map with the connectivity (queen) between the states looks like this:
```R
plot(statemap,border="blue",axes=TRUE,las=1)
plot(map.link,coords=map.centroid, pch=19,cex=0.1,col="red",add=T)

```

The inverse distance weigth matris is calculated as follows:
```R
mydm<-rdist.earth(mycoords)              # computes distance in miles. 
for(i in 1:dim(mydm)[1]) {mydm[i,i] = 0} # renders exactly zero all diagonal elements
mydm[mydm > 500] <- 0                    # all distances > 500 miles are set to zero
mydm<-ifelse(mydm!=0, 1/mydm, mydm)      # inverting distances
mydm.lw<-mat2listw(mydm, style="W")      # create a (normalized) listw object
```
And the connectivity between the states looks like this;

```R
plot(statemap,border="blue",axes=TRUE,las=1)
plot(mydm.lw,coords=mycoords, pch=19, cex=0.1,col="red",add=T)
title("Inverse Distance Spatial Links Among States")  
```

We then calculate the Moran's I, which is a correlation coefficient that measures the overall spatial autocorrelation of the data. In this case, we are going to check the spatial autocorrelation in FDI at the state-level using the inverse distance spatial matrix.

```R
moran.mc(statemap$FDI2003,mydm.lw,nsim=9999)
```
And the output is something like this:

Showing spatial autocorrelation for FDI in 2003. Below is a table with the results for some of the years of the data:

![Contiguity Map](https://github.com/pmcavallo/pmcavallo.github.io/blob/master/images/moran2.PNG?raw=true)

The results show some significant correlation coefficients. 

We then bring in some variables to control for the quality of a state's market (GDP per capita), the size of the state (population), the level of human capital/skill (education), and the quality of a state's infrastructure (road mileage). Next, we format the data set as panel data:

```R
data <- read.dta(file.choose())
datapd<-pdata.frame(data,index=c("StateID","Year"))
```

Next we test for fixed or random effects in panel data (Hausman test) and employ a couple of Lagrange Multiplier tests for spatial error and/or spatial lag dependence. Depending on what these LM tests find, we run a Spatial Autoregressive model (SAR), a Spatial Error model (SEM), or a combined model (SARAR).

```R
model <- LogFDI ~ log(Pop) + log(GDPpc) + log(College) + log(Mileage)

fe <- plm(model, data=datapd, model = "within")      #fixed-effects model
re <- plm(model, data=datapd, model = "random")      #random-effects model
phtest(re, fe)                                       #Hausman Test

# LM tests for spatial lag correlation in panel models
slmtest(model, data=datapd, listw=mydm.lw, test="lml") 

# LM test for spatial error correlation in panel models
slmtest(model, data=datapd, listw=mydm.lw, test="lme")

```

The test statistics for the Hausman Test is 6.2418 with a p-value of 0.1818, providing evidence for the random effects model. Both Lagrange Multiplier tests also show spatial error and spatial lag dependence in the data. We therefore run a SARAR random-effects model to control for both dependence:

```R
sarar <- spml(model,data=datapd,index=NULL,listw=mydm.lw,model="random",lag=TRUE, spatial.error="kkp",LeeYu=T)
summary(sarar)
```

The control variables show the expected direction with the exception of GDP per capita, which is not significant, suggesting FDI is not necessarily attracted to rich states. Population, road mileage, and education are all positive and significant, suggesting FDI is attracted to larger states with high-skilled labor and a good infrastucture. The most important finding is the lambda coefficient, which captures the spatial lag of the dependent variable. The lambda coefficient is positive and highly signficant, suggesting there is spatial autocorrelation in FDI, meaning states that are closer to states receiving a large inflow of FDI will receive more FDI.
