title: Spatial Data
---

This example uses geocoded foreign direct investment (FDI) data to analyze and control for spatial correlation:

The data for this project comes from the *Finantial Times, BEA, and EMSI*, and the unit of analysis is Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the US. The dependent variable is greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) (thousands of U$ Dollars). This greenfield data eliminates not only the liquid capital component but also Mergers & Acqusitions (M&A), leaving only the job-creating component city officials are eager to attract.

The main idea of this project, first, is to investigate if FDI clusters geographcally, meaning, do some MSAsâ€™ outcomes depend on the outcomes in other MSAs? In other words, is FDI contagious from MSAs to neighboring or otherwise proximate MSAs? For instance, are Baltimore and Philadelphia receiving more investment than Dallas and Denver due to their proximity to major FDI destinationssuch as NYC, Boston, and DC?

The first step is to check if there is spatial autocorrelation in the FDI data.
